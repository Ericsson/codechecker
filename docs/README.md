**CodeChecker** is a static analysis infrastructure built on the [LLVM/Clang
Static Analyzer](http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org) toolchain, replacing
[`scan-build`](http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/scan-build.html) in a Linux or
macOS (OS X) development environment.

**:bulb: Check out our [DEMO](https://codechecker-demo.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com) showing some analysis results of open-source projects!**

# Main features
## Command line C/C++ Analysis
  * Executes [_Clang-Tidy_](http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/), [_Clang Static Analyzer_](http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/) with Cross-Translation Unit analysis, Statistical Analysis (when checkers are available), [_Cppcheck_](https://cppcheck.sourceforge.io/), [_GCC Static Analyzer_](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/StaticAnalyzer) and the [_Facebook Infer Analyzer_](https://fbinfer.com).
  * Creates the JSON compilation database by wiretapping any build process (e.g., `CodeChecker log -b "make"`).
  * Automatically analyzes GCC cross-compiled projects: detecting GCC or Clang compiler configuration and forming the corresponding clang analyzer invocations.
  * Incremental analysis: Only the changed files and its dependencies need to be reanalyzed.
  * False positive suppression with a possibility to add review comments.
  * Result visualization in command line or in static HTML.

## Web-based report storage
  * **You can store & visualize thousands of analysis reports** of many analyzers like
    Clang Static Analyzer (C/C++), Clang Tidy (C/C++), Facebook Infer (C/C++, Java), Clang Sanitizers (C/C++), Spotbugs (Java), Pylint (Python), Eslint (Javascript) ...  
    For a complete list see [Supported Analyzers](supported_code_analyzers.md)
  * **Web application** for viewing discovered code defects with a streamlined,
    easy experience (with PostgreSQL, or SQLite backend).
  * **Gerrit and GitLab integration** Shows analysis results as [GitLab](gitlab_integration.md) or [Gerrit](jenkins_gerrit_integration.md) reviews.
  * **Filterable** (defect checker name, severity, source paths, ...) and
    **comparable** (calculates difference between two analyses of the project,
    showing which bugs have been fixed and which are newly introduced) result
    viewing.
  * **Diff mode:** This shows the list of bugs that have been introduced since your last analyzer
    execution.
  * Results can be shared with fellow developers, the **comments** and
    **review** system helps communication of code defects.
  * Easily implementable [Thrift](http://thrift.apache.org)-based
    server-client communication used for storing and querying of discovered
    defects.
  * Support for multiple bug visualization frontends, such as the web
    application, a [command-line tool](usage.md) and an
    [Eclipse plugin](http://github.com/Ericsson/CodeCheckerEclipsePlugin).

# Usage flow
![Usage diagram](images/usage_flow.png)

- *Step 1*: `CodeChecker log` runs the given build command and records the
executed compilation steps. These steps are written to an output file
(Compilation Database) in a JSON format.
- *Step 2*: `CodeChecker analyze` uses the previously created JSON Compilation
Database to perform an analysis on the project, outputting analysis results in
a machine-readable (plist) format.
- *Step 3*: In this step, you can do multiple things:
    - Parse and pretty-print the summary and results from analysis result files
    (`CodeChecker parse`).
    - Store the results to a running CodeChecker server (`CodeChecker store`).
    - Compare two analysis results/runs to show the results that differ between
    the two (`CodeChecker cmd diff`).
    - etc.

For more information how to use CodeChecker see our [user guide](usage.md).

# Install guide

## Install CodeChecker via `pip`
CodeChecker is available on the [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/codechecker/)
and can be installed with the following command:
```sh
pip3 install codechecker
```

**Note:** this package can be installed on `Linux`, `OSX` and `Windows`
systems where `pip3` command is available. On `OSX`, `intercept-build` must be
installed for logging (`CodeChecker log`). On `Windows`, logging is not
available.

## Installing CodeChecker via the `snap` package manager
CodeChecker is available on the [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/codechecker)
and can be installed with the following command:
```sh
sudo snap install codechecker --classic
```

**Note:** Unfortunately, the snap package supports only lower-case command names.
For this reason, you need to use `codechecker` command instead of `CodeChecker`
everywhere. For a full list of available commands in the _codechecker_ snap
package, run `snap info codechecker`.

## Linux

For a detailed dependency list, and for instructions on how to install newer
Clang and Clang-Tidy versions, please see [Requirements](deps.md).
The following commands are used to bootstrap CodeChecker on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS:

```sh
# Install mandatory dependencies for a development and analysis environment.
# NOTE: clang or clang-tidy can be any sufficiently fresh version, and need not
#       come from package manager!
#       In case of Cppcheck, the minimal supported version is 1.80.
#       In case of gcc, the minimal supported version is 13.0.0.
#       Infer: https://fbinfer.com/docs/getting-started
sudo apt-get install clang clang-tidy cppcheck g++ build-essential curl
      gcc-multilib git python3-dev python3-venv python3-setuptools

# In case of venv_dev target and Ubuntu 23 Linux, install an additional library:
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev

# Install nodejs dependency for web. In case of Debian/Ubuntu you can use the
# following commands. For more information see the official docs:
# https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Check out CodeChecker source code.
git clone https://github.com/Ericsson/CodeChecker.git --depth 1 ~/codechecker
cd ~/codechecker

# Create a Python virtualenv and set it as your environment.
# NOTE: if you want to develop CodeChecker, use the `venv_dev` target instead
# of `venv`.
make venv
source $PWD/venv/bin/activate

# [Optional] If you want to use external authentication methods (LDAP / PAM)
# follow the instructions in
# docs/web/authentication.md#external-authentication-methods

# Build and install a CodeChecker package.
make package

# For ease of access, add the build directory to PATH.
export PATH="$PWD/build/CodeChecker/bin:$PATH"

cd ..
```

**Notes**:
- By default, `make package` will build ldlogger shared objects for
`32bit` and `64bit` too. If you would like to build and package `64 bit only`
shared objects and ldlogger binary you can set `BUILD_LOGGER_64_BIT_ONLY`
environment variable to `YES` before the package build:
`BUILD_LOGGER_64_BIT_ONLY=YES make package`.
- By default, the `make package` will build the UI code if it's not built yet
or the UI code is changed. If you wouldn't like to build the UI code you can
set the `BUILD_UI_DIST` environment variable to `NO` before the package build:
`BUILD_UI_DIST=NO make package`.
- Use `make standalone_package` instead of `make package` to avoid
having to manually activate the environment before running CodeChecker.

### Upgrading environment after system or Python upgrade

If you have upgraded your system's Python to a newer version (e.g., from
`3.8` to `3.11` &ndash; this is the case when upgrading Ubuntu from
20.04 LTS to 22.04 LTS), the installed environment will not work
out-of-the-box. To fix this issue, run the following command to upgrade your
`checker_env` too:

```sh
cd ~/codechecker/venv
python3 -m venv .
```

## Mac OS X
For installation instructions for Mac OS X see [Mac OS X Installation Guide](install_macosx.md) documentation.

## Docker
To run the CodeChecker server in Docker see the [Docker](web/docker.md) documentation.
You can find the CodeChecker web-server container at the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/codechecker/codechecker-web).

For more information how to install and use this plugin see the
[repository](https://github.com/Ericsson/codecheckervsCodePlugin/) of this
extension.

## GitHub Actions CI

![CodeChecker executed in GitHub Actions](images/github-actions.png)

CodeChecker can be executed via a reusable GitHub action for your project!
You need only specify the build command, as if you would run the analysis
locally.

For more information, check out the
[CodeChecker Static Analysis](http://github.com/marketplace/actions/codechecker-static-analysis)
action on the GitHub Actions Marketplace.

# Analyze your first project

## Setting up the environment in your Terminal

These steps must always be taken in a new command prompt you wish to execute
analysis in.

```sh
source ~/codechecker/venv/bin/activate

# Path of CodeChecker package
# NOTE: SKIP this line if you want to always specify CodeChecker's full path.
export PATH=~/codechecker/build/CodeChecker/bin:$PATH

# Path of the built LLVM/Clang
# NOTE: SKIP this line if clang is available in your PATH as an installed Linux package.
export PATH=~/<user path>/build/bin:$PATH
```
## Execute analysis

Analyze your project with the `check` command:

    CodeChecker check -b "cd ~/your-project && make clean && make" -o ./results

`check` will print an overview of the issues found in your project by the
analyzers. The reports will be stored in the `./results` directory in `plist` 
XML format.

## Export the reports as static HTML files
You can visualize the results as static HTML by executing

`CodeChecker parse -e html ./results -o ./reports_html`

An index page will be generated with a list of all repors in 
`./reports_html/index.html` 


## Optionally store the results in Web server & view the results

If you have hundreds of results, you may want to store them on the web
server with a database backend.

Start a CodeChecker web and storage server in another terminal or as a
background process. By default, it will listen on `localhost:8001`.

The SQLite database containing the reports will be placed in your workspace
directory (`~/.codechecker` by default), which can be provided via the `-w`
flag.

    CodeChecker server

Store your analysis reports onto the server to be able to use the Web Viewer.

    CodeChecker store ./results -n my-project

Open the [CodeChecker Web Viewer](http://localhost:8001) in your browser, and
you should be greeted with a web application showing you the analysis results.
