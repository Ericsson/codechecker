# 1. Install/register GitLab Runner
GitLab Runner is the open source project that is used to run your jobs and
send the results back to GitLab. You have to
[install](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/) it on a machine where
your analysis will be performed.

To register the runner with GitLab first you need to get a registration token
from the GitLab web interface. It is generated by GitLab and it can be found in
your projects settings under
`settings/ci_cd/Set up a specific Runner manually`.

Once GitLab Runner is installed and you get the token, you need to register the
runner with GitLab. You can use the following command:
```sh
sudo gitlab-runner register \
    --non-interactive \
    --url "https://mycompany.gitlab.com" \
    --registration-token "<REGISTRATION_TOKEN_FROM_GITLAB>" \
    --description "codechecker" \
    --executor "shell"
```

You can find more information how to
[register a GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/).

# 2. Define a job in your .gitlab-ci.yml
GitLab CI/CD pipelines are configured using a YAML file called `.gitlab-ci.yml`
within each project. Create this file in your project root directory:

```yml
code_quality:
  script:
    - bash .gitlab/ci/run_codechecker.sh
  after_script:
    - cat gl-code-quality-report.json
  artifacts:
    reports:
      codequality: gl-code-quality-report.json
    paths: [gl-code-quality-report.json]
    expire_in: '2 mos'
    expose_as: 'Code Quality Report'
  stage: test
```

`expire_in` allows you to specify how long artifacts should live before they
expire and are therefore deleted. You can set it to a lower or a higher value.
For more information
[see](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html#artifactsexpire_in).

`expose_as` makes the report JSON file downloadable directly from the ongoing
merge requests.

Script is a shell script which will be executed by the Runner.

# 3. Create a script to run CodeChecker analysis
Create a shell script in your project under `.gitlab/ci/run_codechecker.sh`.
This script will run the analysis and it has to create a json file called
`gl-code-quality-report.json` which will contain reports in Code Climate
format. CodeChecker from version `6.12.0` is able to generate Code Climate
output by using the *CodeChecker parse* or *CodeChecker cmd diff* commands:

## Using CodeChecker parse
```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Log your project.
CodeChecker log -b "make" -o ./compilation_database.json

# Analyze your project.
CodeChecker analyze --ctu \
  -o ./reports \
  ./compilation_database.json

# Create the report file by using the CodeChecker parse command.
CodeChecker parse \
  --trim-path-prefix $(pwd) \
  -e codeclimate \
  ./reports > gl-code-quality-report.json

# Exit with status code 1 if the report file was not generated.
if [ ! -f "gl-code-quality-report.json" ]; then
  echo Report file (gl-code-quality-report.json) does not exist."
  exit 1
fi
```

## Using CodeChecker cmd diff
```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Log your project.
CodeChecker log -b "make" -o ./compilation_database.json

# Analyze your project.
CodeChecker analyze --ctu \
  -o ./reports \
  ./compilation_database.json

# Or you can create a report by using the CodeChecker diff command.
CC_REPO_DIR="$(pwd)" \
CodeChecker cmd diff \
  -b my_remote_run \
  --url your_baseline_url \
  -n ./reports \
  --new \
  -o codeclimate \
  -e ./codeclimate

out_file="codeclimate/codeclimate_issues.json"

if [ ! -f "$out_file" ]; then
  echo "Report file (${out_file}) does not exist."
  exit 1
fi

cp $out_file gl-code-quality-report.json
```

# 4. Create a merge request
Create a merge request which will contain the `.gitlab-ci.yml` and the
`.gitlab/ci/run_codechecker.sh` files.

Once the Code Quality job has completed, potential changes to code quality are
shown directly in the merge request. If the Code Quality report doesnâ€™t have
anything to compare to, no information will be displayed in the merge request
area. You may see the following message: *Failed to load codeclimate report*.
That is the case when you add the Code Quality job in your `.gitlab-ci.yml`
for the very first time.

For more information
[see](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/code_quality.html).

# Possible errors
## Runner is outdated
The GitLab Runner version should be in sync with the GitLab version. You will
see the following message is your runner is outdated:
```sh
Error: `Your runner is outdated, please upgrade your runner`
```

You can upgrade it by using the following commands:
```sh
curl -L https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/runner/gitlab-runner/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
apt-cache madison gitlab-runner
sudo apt-get install gitlab-runner=12.9.0
```

For more information
[see](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/#compatibility-with-gitlab-versions).

## Service run failed
If something is not working properly with the runners you can see the logs by
using the following command: `sudo journalctl -u gitlab-runner`. If you see the
following error message in the logs:
```sh
FATAL: Service run failed  error=chdir /var/lib/gitlab-runner: no such file or directory
```

you have to do the following steps:
```sh
sudo mkdir /var/lib/gitlab-runner/
sudo chown -R gitlab-runner:gitlab-runner /var/lib/gitlab-runner/
```
