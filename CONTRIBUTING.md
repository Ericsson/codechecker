# Issue report guidelines

Please insert every possible information you can obtain that could help us
reproduce and triage your issue. This usually includes:

* The relevant parts from CodeChecker's output.
* The version number of CodeChecker &ndash; execute
   `CodeChecker version --verbose debug` and copy the value for `Git tag info`.
* What you were trying to do.
* What behaviour was expected instead of what happened.

## Contribution guidelines

### Python style

In CodeChecker, we use [pycodestyle](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycodestyle/)
and [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) to automatically check our coding style.
`pycodestyle` and `pylint` are enforced by the test infrastructure &ndash;
if you write a new module outside the current directory structure, make sure to
add its path to [`web/tests/Makefile`](`web/tests/Makefile`) or
[`analyzer/tests/Makefile`](analyzer/tests/Makefile) under the `pycodestyle`
and `pylint` targets.

In addition to the general rules of `pycodestyle`, please keep the following
rules while writing your code:

* Comments must be whole sentences, beginning with a capital letter and
    ending with a closing `.`.

### Order of `import` commands

Order your `import` commands according to as follows:

  1. **System-wide** imports come first and foremost, e.g.
    `import subprocess`.
  2. _(Empty line for readability)_
  3. External module/library imports that are not system-wide but related to
     CodeChecker's **dependencies**, e.g. `from thrift import Thrift`.
  4. _(Empty line)_
  5. **API** imports, e.g. `import shared` and `from Authentication import
     ttypes`. The only special rule about this clause is that `import shared`
     comes before every _other_ API import.
  6. _(Empty line)_
  7. Modules from CodeChecker's own library's, `codechecker_common`,
  `codechecker_analyzer`, `codechecker_web`, `codechecker_client`,
  `codechecker_server` etc.
  8. _(Empty line)_
  9. Imports from the package where the file you are writing is located in.

Between each of these _levels_, imports are sorted alphabetically on the
importing module's name, even if we only import a single class or function from
it.

#### Example

The example below should concisely show how module imports should be
structured:

```py
# ...General LICENSE information and file header...
"""
Documentation about the module.
"""

# -- 1. System specific imports
import atexit
from collections import defaultdict
import os
import tempfile

# -- 3. CodeChecker dependency imports
from alembic import config  # sorted as 'a'
import sqlalchemy
from sqlalchemy.engine import Engine
from thrift import Thrift
from thrift.Thrift import TException
from thrift.protocol import TJSONProtocol

# -- 5. API imports
import shared
from Authentication import codeCheckerAuthentication
from Authentication import constants
from codeCheckerDBAccess import codeCheckerDBAccess
from codeCheckerDBAccess.ttypes import *

# -- 7. codechecker_analyzer, codechecker_common and subpackages, etc.
from codechecker_analyzer import analyzer
from codechecker_analyzer.analyzers import analyzer_types
from codechecker_analyzer.buildlog import build_action
from codechecker_common import host_check
from codechecker_common import util

# -- 9. imports from the local package
from . import client_db_access_handler
from product_db_access_handler import ThriftProductHandler

# ... your code here
```

### Code quality

Any change in the Pull Request against the codechecker repository will be checked
with CodeChecker itself for potential issues. If any new issue found, the Pull Request
cannot be merged before fixing them.

#### Running quality check locally

Quality check script can also be used locally which needs setting up the environment before the first run:

* Create a local settings file for automatically logging in to the CodeChecker Code Quality server

``` json
{
 "client_autologin" : true,
 "credentials": {
  "https://codechecker-demo.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com": "codechecker:codechecker"
 }
}
```

* Run `ci/github_analysis/codechecker_gate_pr.sh` to analyze the code.

__Important:__ Make sure you are running CodeChecker version equal or lower than the server version when running the script! Always check the current version at: https://codechecker-demo.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/

### Directory layout

#### `analyzer`

This folder contains source code of the CodeChecker `analyzer` and
`build-logger`.

The `build-logger` can be found under the `tools` folder. This can be used to
capture the build process and generate a JSON compilation database.

#### `bin`

This folder contains entry points of the CodeChecker package such as
`codechecker-version` and wrapper scripts.

#### `codechecker_common`

`codechecker_common` is a python package where all common CodeChecker related
source code is found which are used by the analyzer and web part of
CodeChecker.

#### `config`

This folder contains common configuration files such as
[`labels`](config/label), `logger.conf` etc. which are used by the
`analyzer` and the `web` part of CodeChecker.

#### `docker`

This folder contains docker related files.

#### `docs`

This folder contains documentation files for the CodeChecker.

#### `scripts`

This folder contains multiple scripts which are used at the build process of
CodeChecker, gerrit integration, debug etc.

#### `tools`

This folder contains tools which are used by the `analyzer` and `web` part
of the CodeChecker such as `tu_collector`.

#### `web`

This folder contains source code of the CodeChecker web server and web client.

### Entry points

CodeChecker is organized into different entry-points based on different
features of the program, such as logging, analysing, result storage, web
server, etc.

A CodeChecker feature having its entry point consists of a bare minimum of
two (2) things:

* An entry point under `bin/codechecker-myfeature`.
* The entry point's definition containing the feature's command-line help and
   argument parser under `cmd/myfeature.py`.

### Libraries

CodeChecker contains multiple python packages:

* `codechecker_common`: used by the analyzer and web part of the CodeChecker.
* `codechecker_analyzer`: contains source code of the CodeChecker analyzer.
* `codechecker_web`: used by the WEB server and client.
* `codechecker_client`: contains source code of the CodeChecker WEB client.
* `codechecker_server`: contains source code of the CodeChecker WEB server.
* `codechecker_api`: python api module files which are generated by a thrift
   compiler.

Additionally, you may use different Python files to store code for your library
for better code organisation. For example a server library code related to
`myfeature` go into the `codechecker_server/myfeature` folder. Please try to
localise your library code in its own folder as much as possible.

Do **NOT** do _cross-subcommand_ import, aka.
`from codechecker_analyzer.analyze` in a `codechecker_server.myfeature` file.
This might change in the future as we consider how to make CodeChecker a more
modular application.

Please execute `scripts/create_new_subcommand.py myfeature` to automatically
generate the skeleton for `myfeature`. Already existing files, such as
`codechecker_analyzer/cmd/log.py` give a nice overview on how entry-point
handlers should be laid out.
